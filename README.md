# Spelling Corrector
This is [Rust] implementation of [Norvig's spelling corrector]. All theory and
other language implementations of spell corrector can be found on his website.
My objective was to explore the the shiny new lanaguage.

In order to run spell corrector

```sh
$ cargo build
```

```sh
$ cargo run <word to correct>
```

Integration tests can be run with

```sh
$ cargo test
